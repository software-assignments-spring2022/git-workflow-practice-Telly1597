[Software Engineers are the backbone of space tech](https://thenextweb.com/news/software-engineers-backbone-of-space-tech)

<!-- Inline Code Block-->

<p> The main reason why I find article fascinating is that it shows how much software engineers have contributed to the exploration of space in recent years. An average guy might think that all engineers do is build application, websites, and very little else. This article shows that Software Enginner contribut to society in a lot of different areas. In most of these areas the general public might of be aware of their contribution or in some cases they might not even be credited for some of them. What this article shows is that Engineers contribute a lot when it comes to space exploration, the article calls Software engineers the backbone of space tech. indeed they are.</p>
